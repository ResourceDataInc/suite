Creating a basic web map with GeoExplorer
=========================================

This section will guide you through the process of creating a basic web map using GeoExplorerâ€”from loading data to a finished map. The following workflow assumes your data is stored as shapefiles, although there are many types of data formats that OpenGeo Suite can load and publish.

The data will be saved in a PostGIS database table and published through GeoServer, but all of that will happen automatically behind-the-scenes just by using GeoExplorer.

For more information about GeoExplorer, please see the `reference documentation <../../geoexplorer/>`_.
