CLI tools
^^^^^^^^^

The CLI tools package contains all the command line tools for OpenGeo Suite:

* :ref:`Boundless SDK <webapps.sdk.install>`
* PostGIS data conversion utilities such as ``shp2pgsql``
* `GDAL/OGR <http://www.gdal.org/>`_ format translation utilities (including Python modules)
* `PDAL <http://www.pointcloud.org/>`_ tools for working with LIDAR point cloud data

.. note:: Boundless SDK requires that a `Java Development Kit (JDK) <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_ is installed on your system in order to run.

To install the CLI Tools:

#. Double-click the :guilabel:`OpenGeo CLI Tools.pkg` file.

      OpenGeo Suite Command Line Tools Installer

#. Work through the installer dialogs accepting the defaults. 

#. The CLI Tools package installs everything into :file:`/usr/local/opengeo`. This directory must be added to the ``PATH``. Add the following line to your :file:`~/.profile`::

     export PATH=/usr/local/opengeo/bin:$PATH

   .. note:: Alternatively you can run the :file:`/usr/local/opengeo/bin/opengeo-clitools-doctor` utility which will create symlinks for all the tools into :file:`/usr/local/bin`. Use this method with caution as it may conflict with different versions of the same tools already installed on the system.

#. Adding the CLI Tools Python modules to PYTHONPATH

   The GDAL/OGR and other Python module utilities will be installed in :file:`/usr/local/opengeo/lib/python2.7/site-packages`. To add this to your ``PYTHONPATH`` you will need to open :file:`~/.profile` in a text editor and add the following to the bottom of the file::

      export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/opengeo/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

   .. warning::  If you have the `QGIS community version <https://www.qgis.org/en/site/index.html>`_ installed, and the :file:`/Libraries/Frameworks/GDAL.framework` exists, you will need to remove ``gdal-py2.7.pth`` and ``numpy-override.pth`` from :file:`/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages` as they manipulate ``sys.path`` and will *always* be found first.
