Working with MongoDB
====================

`MongoDB <https://www.mongodb.org/>`_ is a document-oriented "NoSQL" database.

MongoDB databases can be loaded as stores in GeoServer, and certain configured collections inside those databases can be published as layers.

.. note:: MongoDB support is only available with `OpenGeo Suite Enterprise <http://boundlessgeo.com/solutions/opengeo-suite/>`_. For more information on OpenGeo Suite Enterprise, please `contact us <http://boundlessgeo.com/about/contact-us/sales/>`_.
