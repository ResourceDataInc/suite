Installation
------------

To install an extension:

#. Extract the contents of the OpenGeo Suite extensions archive.

#. Locate the directory that contains the extension to install (such as :file:`wps` for the WPS extension).

#. Copy the files in that directory to the GeoServer library path. This path is often :file:`webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib`, where :file:`webapps` is the application server's web applications directory.

   .. note:: You may be warned about overwriting existing files. This is okay.

#. Restart the application server.

#. Confirm that the extension was installed properly. Typically, the feature will be displayed on the GeoServer Welcome page, or as an available data source.
