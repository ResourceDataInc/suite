Installing QGIS for OpenGeo Suite
=================================

Boundless provides packages for QGIS on both Windows and OS X.

To use QGIS with Linux, please see the `QGIS community installation instructions <https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html>`_.

.. warning::

   For Linux users, **please do not try to run QGIS on the same machine as OpenGeo Suite**, as package conflicts will occur (specifically with GDAL). If you install OpenGeo Suite on a machine that has QGIS, **QGIS may be automatically uninstalled!**

   Instead, use QGIS on a different machine and connect to OpenGeo Suite services from there.
