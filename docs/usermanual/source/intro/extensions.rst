OpenGeo Suite extensions
========================

OpenGeo Suite comes with a number of optional extensions or "add-ons". These add functionality to OpenGeo Suite, but may not be needed by most users. We recommend that you choose only the extensions that you need.

These optional components can be selected in different ways depending on your operating system:

* **Windows**: Extensions can be selected during the :ref:`Windows installation process <intro.installation.windows.components>` or by rerunning the installer after OpenGeo Suite is installed.
* **OS X**: Extensions can be added by :ref:`manually copying the extension files <intro.installation.mac.install.extensions>` after OpenGeo Suite is installed.
* **Ubuntu Linux**: Extensions can be installed via :ref:`packages <intro.installation.ubuntu.packages>`.
* **Red Hat-based Linux**: Extensions can be installed by via :ref:`packages <intro.installation.redhat.packages>`.

For users of OpenGeo Suite for Application Servers, please `contact Boundless <http://boundlessgeo.com/about-us/contact/>`_ to receive access to the extensions and information on how to install them.

.. note:: Most of these extensions only available with `OpenGeo Suite Enterprise <http://boundlessgeo.com/solutions/opengeo-suite/>`_. For more information on OpenGeo Suite Enterprise, please `contact us <http://boundlessgeo.com/about/contact-us/sales/>`_.
