YSLD tutorial
=============

This tutorial provides a set of steps that users can follow to style layers and compose a map using :ref:`Suite Composer <webmaps.composer>`.

For this tutorial, you will need to download the following files from the `Natural Earth dataset <http://www.naturalearthdata.com/>`_:

.. include:: files/data.txt

These four files should be imported into Composer as new layers. This tutorial will assume that the layers were renamed to be ``countries``, ``roads``, ``places``, and ``DEM``, respectively.

.. note:: For information on how to load this data into Composer, please see the :ref:`Composer tutorial <webmaps.composer.tutorial>`.

The following pages will demonstrate how to style each of these layers to compose a map. The tutorial is divided into five steps. The first four steps will style each of the layers individually, and then the final step will be to compose the finished map.
