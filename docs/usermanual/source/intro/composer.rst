Composer
========

OpenGeo Suite Composer is a tool for creating, styling and publishing maps. It runs in the same container as GeoServer, accessible at ``/composer/``. So if GeoServer exists at ``http://localhost:8080/geoserver/``, Composer is available at ``http://localhost:8080/geoserver/composer/``
