PostGIS.app
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: While it is possible to run the PostGIS application directly from the installer disk image, we recommend you drag it to :file:`/Applications` and run from there.

PostGIS ships as a self-contained application. Start by double-clicking :guilabel:`PostGIS.app`. You will see a "Welcome" window the first time the application is launched.
